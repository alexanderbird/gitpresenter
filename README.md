# GitPresenter

A command line tool for stepping through git commits like one steps through slides in a PowerPoint -- for git-powered "live" code demos.

## Prerequisites

Node > 22 (although you may get by with 20 version)

## Usage

   ./index.mjs

The script compiles `src` automatically and then runs it -- no extra build step
is required.
